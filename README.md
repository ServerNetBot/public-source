# ServerNet Source Code
I'm a strong believer of making stuff open source. Here is all the source code we no longer use on the bot published. This will have newer versions as the bot gets updates!

## Versions

| Version | Open Source | Released | In Dev | Planned |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
|    1    |   ❌       |   ✅    |  ❌   |   ❌   |
|    2    |   ❌       |   ❌    |  ✅   |   ✅   |
|    3    |   ❌       |   ❌    |  ❌   |   ❌   |
